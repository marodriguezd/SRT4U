00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,520
About Me

2
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,526
Everybody, welcome to the course.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,527
My name is Even.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,219
I'm a concept artist
and illustrator from Norway.

5
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:18,174
Since we'll be spending
a good bit of time together

6
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:19,697
doing what we'll be doing,

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,024
I figured it's a good chance right now
to introduce myself

8
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,298
and let you know a bit about who I am.

9
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:33,302
I come from a family
of mostly engineers and teachers.

10
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:35,397
Though there are artists in my family,

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,278
I'm probably the first to take it on
as a professional vocation.

12
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:43,324
I went to high school
where we were allowed specialize

13
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:45,652
in different core structures early.

14
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:49,252
I got to do art, but it wasn't helpful

15
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:52,292
because there was no real career path
to do what I do today.

16
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,972
Concept art wasn't a word,

17
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:59,834
so we had the fine selection of doing
comic books or strips for newspapers.

18
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:01,310
There was the idea of tattooing

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,532

20
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,724
or we could go into fine arts,
the impossible-to-enter field.

21
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:10,027
Only later when I got into art school

22
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,359
did the idea occur
that, "Hey, there are video games

23
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:18,219
and someone has to be drawing
all of those characters and things."

24
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:20,487
At art school,
I got into an internet forum

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,242
called ConceptArt.org
which had a great sketchbook forum

26
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:29,925
that allowed us to exchange our studies
and sketches, and comment on each other.

27
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:32,739
Furthermore, there were
lots of professionals there

28
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:35,759
who gave us tips and tricks
and talked to us

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,479
about what it was like
to be a concept artist.

30
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,412
A lot of them proffer this idea
of just showing up,

31
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:43,891
being there,
taking the initiative, so I did.

32
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:45,724
There was a game studio in Oslo

33
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:48,264
that I took the bus past every day
called Funcom.

34
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:51,157
They made lots of games
like "Conan," "Exodus,"

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,002
and "The Longest Journey,"
you might have played them.

36
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,994
I showed up and snuck in

37
00:01:56,997 --> 00:02:02,167
after a burly gentleman
in a leather trench coat and cowboy hat.

38
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,319
I thought that's someone
who works in games.

39
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,042
After having sat in the lobby a bit,

40
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,566
the poor receptionist looked at me
and asked if I had an appointment.

41
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,137
I said,
"Yes, to meet the concept-art people."

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,551
She apologized and said,

43
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:17,571
"Sorry, they're busy today,
can you come back next week?"

44
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,900
I was like, "Yes, mission accomplished."

45
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:24,396
Next week, I got to come back
and a confused art director

46
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:28,092
showed me
and one of my co-students around

47
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:32,452
and explained what the job was
and we were both sold completely.

48
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:35,463
That's been my thing ever since.

49
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:40,571
After art school,
I went to Cornwell in the UK

50
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,981
to try and do a degree
because they told us we should do that.

51
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,739
I wasn't a good student there.

52
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:49,689
Also, it was an illustration course
and they didn't do concept art.

53
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:53,912
They told us that if we wanted
to concept something out, use a collage,

54
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,959
and I was like, "No, that's not for me."

55
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:58,215
I ran away, as I often do,

56
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:03,268
and got through many
of these ConceptArt.org contacts.

57
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:07,339
The news was that
a small studio in Canada

58
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,892
was looking for junior artists.

59
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:12,494
The studio was VOLTA,
and after having gone over

60
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:15,398
their art test deadline
by about a month and a half,

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,593
they didn't notice, I didn't tell them,

62
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:20,515
and they said, "This is a good art test,
come work for us?"

63
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:21,596
I said, "Yes."

64
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,422
I got to go to Canada.

65
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,314
I stayed there for about three years.

66
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:29,021
Then some other colleagues
had gone to freelance in Prague,

67
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,137
so I followed them.

68
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,687
After about a year and a half there,
I got an interesting email.

69
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,838
The email seemed a little dodgy.

70
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:40,237
When you get an email from studios,

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,219
they have big icons underneath
and the role of the person emailing you.

72
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:50,082
This was from a personal email account,
and it was simply this guy who said

73
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,774
that he was running
the cinematics team at Blizzard

74
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:55,287
and did I want to come to California
and work.

75
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,843
I was like, "Ha, ha, ha,
someone's fooling me around here."

76
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:04,479
I sent him a dismissive email back
and said, "Funny joke.

77
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,508
It's Christmas day, not a good time."

78
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:10,904
About 15 minutes later,
I got an email back saying, "No joke.

79
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,856
I run the cinematics team at Blizzard."

80
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,132
I was floored.

81
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:15,719
Blizzard is fantastic.

82
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,571
I'd been a huge fan of "Warcraft III"
and the answer was clear,

83
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,988
"I want to come to Blizzard
and work for cinematics."

84
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,889
It was a team that was made up
of fantastic artists.

85
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,537
Jake Panian is one of them

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,983
and Laurel Austin,
who you might have heard of.

87
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,434
They're my heroes
and I worked with them.

88
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:38,160
It was amazing but,
and this is a lesson for everybody,

89
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,509
figure out what your price is
as a few things didn't work out for me.

90
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:47,311
One, I'm not great
with overly summery places.

91
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,394
I'm Norwegian and I need my seasons.

92
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:53,018
Six months into California,
I was going a little stir crazy.

93
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:59,009
Secondly, the reason I left VOLTA
was I was done with studio culture.

94
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,247
I'm not huge on studio politics,

95
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,647
and that was part of the reason
why after six months at Blizzard,

96
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,860
I felt the pressure to leave.

97
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,382
Halfway through my time,

98
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:14,432
I started doing daily drawings
that started turning into a project.

99
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:18,187
I had a friend over for Christmas
and he'd given me this challenge,

100
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,944
and it started snowballing

101
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:23,216
and I started drawing
these characters that I started liking.

102
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,907
I repeated some characters
and come up with stories for them.

103
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,365
I think you know where I'm going
but we'll get back to that.

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,712
After I decided that, "I'm out of here.

105
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:35,927
I won't stick around."

106
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,065
Blizzard is great,
California's great, but not for me,

107
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,301
I need to be elsewhere.

108
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:44,897
I got a nice email
from a friend of mine in Copenhagen

109
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,384
who works at a tiny little studio
called Embarrassing Company,

110
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:49,526
which is fantastic.

111
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,727
He said they have a table in the corner
if I ever wanted to come,

112
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,079
and I was like,
"Is that table still free?"

113
00:05:55,082 --> 00:06:00,141
It was, so I switched
my fancy Blizzard desk for a tiny table

114
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:04,837
in a corner of a tiny studio
in Copenhagen and I was happy.

115
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,882
From there, I went back to freelancing

116
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,529
and worked with companies
like Magic: The Gathering,

117
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,817
where I'd been trying
to get work for years and had no luck.

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,584
Then one email from Jesper Ejsing,
who was my studio mate,

119
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:21,157
he cleared it all up and got me work
from Magic: The Gathering,

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,159
which was fantastic, among other things.

121
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:25,507
Then something fantastic happened.

122
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,234
I got to go to an event in Dubai

123
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:31,277
where I met a lady who is now my wife

124
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:37,537
and long story short, we moved to Norway
after a lot of traveling around.

125
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,582
That's where I'm working now,
in our apartment with our two cats,

126
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:46,296
building worlds and creating things
out of the fog in my mind.

127
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,643
It's a pretty good way of making money.

128
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,222
Do you remember those sketches

129
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:55,265
that I was talking about at the tail end
of my Blizzard game?

130
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:56,672
They became a thing.

131
00:06:56,973 --> 00:07:01,084
That entire year, first, in California,
and then in Copenhagen, I kept doing it.

132
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,911
Every day I would sit down after work
and do another sketch.

133
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:08,589
I'd started posting them on Instagram

134
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:13,725
and it started getting a following
and it was a self-perpetuating engine.

135
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,992
Little by little,
that became a longer project

136
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:21,957
until I'd gone
through the entirety of 2016 every day.

137
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,084
It was 366 drawings,

138
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:27,959
at which point, I was thinking
"I'll compose it into a PDF

139
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:30,312
and put on the internet,
and anyone can have it.

140
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,314
That's fine by me.

141
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,026
I'm more interested
in the next thing coming along."

142
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,053
but a friend of mine grabbed me
and said, "Are you insane?

143
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,582
We can make books."

144
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,084
So, "Tegn" was born.

145
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,764
That guy, Spiridon Giannakis,
is my graphic designer

146
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,372
and a fantastic friend to have.

147
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,809
Those books became larger projects.

148
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:54,017
I started building on it more concisely.

149
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,016
I started building out
the world, little continents,

150
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,999
ideas of cities and factions,
larger groups and stories,

151
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:04,749
and it became this living little thing.

152
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:09,373
What we'll be doing today is diving
into yet another one of the characters

153
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:11,362
that make up the Tegn world.

154
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,259
Throughout this whole crazy story,

155
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:17,339
artists have had
different effects on me.

156
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:21,027
In the next video, I'll take you
through some that have left a footprint

157
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,772
on how I work,
why I do the things that I do,

158
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,773
and why I'm fascinated
with the aesthetics that I go for.
